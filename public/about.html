  <hr />
  <ul class="list-disc">
    <li class="ml-5">Dice notation is in the form (number of dice)d(dice sides). e.g. 2d10.</li>
    <li class="ml-5">Additional dice can be chained with + and - operators. e.g. 2d10+1d6.</li>
    <li class="ml-5">Modifiers can also be specified. e.g. 2d10-5</li>
    <li class="ml-5">d% can be used as a shorthand for a percentile dice. 1d% and 1d100 are equivalent.</li>
    <li class="ml-5">Append a roll with -L to drop the lowest dice in that group, or -H to drop the highest. Dropped dice are excluded from the total. e.g. 2d20-L will roll 2 twenty sided dice and drop the lowest. You can also specify a number of dice to drop e.g. 6d6-H3 will drop the highest 3 rolls.</li>
    <li class="ml-5">No notation is currently provided for fudge dice. You can use 1d3-2 instead.</li>
    <li class="ml-5">Whitespace, and anything else not recognised as a dice or a modifier, is treated like a + operator. e.g. foo10 1d4bar1d4  5 is equivalent to 5+1d4+1d4+10, or simply 2d4+15.</li>
